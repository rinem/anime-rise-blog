# AnimeRise Blog Site
A blog site created using NodeJS to share anime reviews and posts. I have used Express in the backend to handle the requests for adding and removing posts and MongoDB as the database. I also used Semantic-UI to style the contents in the site.
I have deployed it on Heroku and it can be viewed here : [Anime-Rise Blog](https://immense-basin-85579.herokuapp.com)
